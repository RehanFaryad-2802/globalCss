  <h2 class="hc">Introduction to Mountains</h2>
  <p class="mtc mp">Mountains are some of the most magnificent natural formations on Earth. They are formed through various geological processes, including tectonic movements and volcanic activity.</p>
  
  <h3 class="sh shc">Folding Mountains</h3>
  <p class="stc sp">Folding mountains are formed when two tectonic plates collide and push the Earth's crust upwards, creating complex folds. The Himalayas are an example of folding mountains.</p>
  
  <h3 class="sh shc">Fault-Block Mountains</h3>
  <p class="tc">Fault-block mountains are created when large blocks of Earth's crust are displaced due to faulting. The Sierra Nevada mountains in the United States are a great example of this type.</p>
  
  <h3 class="sh shc">Volcanic Mountains</h3>
  <p class="tc">Volcanic mountains are formed by volcanic activity. As magma rises from beneath the Earth's surface and erupts, it creates a mountain. Mount Fuji in Japan is a famous example.</p>
